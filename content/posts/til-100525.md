### utmpdump
Exploring a binary wtmp file to gather login/logout users sessions?
`utmpdump` is a life saver. Seems to be a core installed command on Linux (at least with debian). 
Otherwise [this github](https://github.com/neko-neko/utmpdump) might help.\
*nice nice*

### last (relearned)
if `utmpdump` is a bit much .. apparently `last` can take a file name! 
`last -f <file>`
throw a `TZ=utc` in front of that command and dates/times will display in UTC\
*who knew!?*

### grep'ing for ip address
`[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}`
